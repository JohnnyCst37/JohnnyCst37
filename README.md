### About Me:

I currently work as a Data Analyst with expertise in Power BI and am transitioning into Data Science, deepening my knowledge of Python and Machine Learning.

My experience as an Executive Director at Tutoreanos Business Consultants has provided me with a strategic business mindset and process optimization skills, applying logic and strategic thinking to solve complex challenges. I am a chess enthusiast, which reflects my focus on strategy and scenario analysis.
